# NBody

An n-body Gravity Simulator by Jackson Campolattaro.

## Concept

The project is an [N-Body newtonian physics simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation). I first adopted the idea because while it's conceptually simple, the emergent properties can be [beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoLe1c-eokI). Originally built as an excersise to learn C++, it's grown to be something larger. I have a lot of plans for the future of this project, but only a limited amount of time. I look forward to incorporating more features and techniques as I learn what's possible!
