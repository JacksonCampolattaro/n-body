### Modular Integrator for N-body Interaction

n-body Gravity Simulator by Jackson Campolattaro

Originally built as an excersise to learn C++, it's grown to be something larger. I have a lot of plans for the future of this project, but only a limited amount of time. I look forward to incorporating more features and techniques as I learn what's possible!
