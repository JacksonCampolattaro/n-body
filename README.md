### Modular Integrator for N-body Interaction

An n-body Gravity Simulator by Jackson Campolattaro.

## Concept

The project is an [N-Body newtonian physics simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation). I originally adopted the idea because while it's conceptually simple, the emergent properties can be [beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoLe1c-eokI). Originally built as an excersise to learn C++, it's grown to be something larger. I have a lot of plans for the future of this project, but only a limited amount of time. I look forward to incorporating more features and techniques as I learn what's possible!

## Progress

I've learned a lot while working on this project. It's been an opportunity to become familiar with project management toosls, several powerful open-source libraries, and important techniques and paradigms.

### Algorithms

I originally built a functioning system using the naive algorithm as a proof of concept. Being new to the language, it was mostly written inside my main.cpp, with only one "body" class to hold information about the orbital bodies. Once I had a working solution, I quicly split out functionality and began my optimization.
