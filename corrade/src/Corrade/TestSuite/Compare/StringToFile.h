/**
@brief Pseudo-type for comparing string to file contents

Prints the length of both files (if they are different) and prints the value
and position of the first different character in both files. Filename is
expected to be in UTF-8. Example usage:

@snippet TestSuite.cpp Compare-StringToFile

See @ref TestSuite-Comparator-pseudo-types for more information.

@section TestSuite-Compare-StringToFile-save-diagnostic Saving files for failed comparisons

The comparator supports the @ref TestSuite-Tester-save-diagnostic "--save-diagnostic option"
--- if the comparison fails, it saves actual file contents to given directory
with a filename matching the expected file. You can use it to perform a manual
data comparison with an external tool or for example to quickly update expected
test data --- point the option to the directory with expected test files and
let the test overwrite them with actual results. The @ref StringToFile variant
supports the same.
