/**
@brief Pseudo-type for comparing file contents to string

Prints the length of both files (if they are different) and prints the value
and position of the first different character in both files. Filename is
expected to be in UTF-8. Example usage:

@snippet TestSuite.cpp Compare-FileToString

See @ref TestSuite-Comparator-pseudo-types for more information.

Unlike @ref File and @ref StringToFile, this comparator *doesn't* support the
@ref TestSuite-Tester-save-diagnostic "--save-diagnostic option", due to the
fact that the comparison is done against a string and so producing a file isn't
that helpful as in the other two variants.

@see @ref File, @ref StringToFile
