@brief Multi-threaded build

Defined if the library is built in a way that makes it possible to safely use
certain Corrade features simultaenously in multiple threads. In particular:

-   @ref Corrade::Utility::Debug "Utility::Debug" and derived classes use it
    to have thread-local scoped output redirection and coloring
-   @ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager "PluginManager::Manager" uses it for
    thread-local plugin loading, unloading and management

Apart from these, @ref Corrade::Utility::Resource "Utility::Resource" uses
global data but isn't affected by this option, as majority of its operation is
only reading from the global storage. All other functionality is free of any
read/write access to global data.

@brief C++ standard version

Expands to `__cplusplus` macro on all sane compilers; on MSVC uses `_MSVC_LANG`

-   @cpp 201703 @ce when C++17 is used
-   greater than @cpp 201703 @ce when C++2a is used

Unlike most other `CORRADE_*` variables, this macro is not exposed to CMake as
because the meaning is unclear in projects that combine more different C++
standards in a single project.
