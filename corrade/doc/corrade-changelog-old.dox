@section corrade-changelog-2015-05 2015.05

Released 2015-05-09, tagged as
[v2015.05](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/releases/tag/v2015.05). See the
[release announcement](https://blog.magnum.graphics/announcements/may-2015-updates/)
for a high-level overview.

@subsection corrade-changelog-2015-05-dependencies Dependency changes

No dependency changes in this release.

@subsection corrade-changelog-2015-05-new New features

-   Support for plugin aliases in @ref PluginManager library.
-   Range-based-for support in @ref Containers::LinkedList.
-   Added convenience @ref PluginManager::Manager::loadAndInstantiate()
    function.
-   Added @ref Containers::Array::slice() "Containers::*Array::slice()" and
    friends.
-   @ref Utility::Debug is able to reuse existing @cpp operator<< @ce overloads
    for @ref std::ostream (see [mosra/corrade#12](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/pull/12))
-   Added @ref Utility::String::beginsWith() and @ref Utility::String::endsWith().

@subsection corrade-changelog-2015-05-changes Changes

-   @ref TestSuite::Compare::Container is now able to compare non-copyable
    containers such as @ref Containers::Array
    (see [mosra/corrade#9](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/9)).
-   Using @cpp const char @ce instead of @cpp const unsigned char @ce for raw
    binary data.
-   Better algorithm for comparing floating-point values in @ref TestSuite.

@subsection corrade-changelog-2015-05-buildsystem Build system

-   CMake now always installs `FindCorrade.cmake` to library-specific location,
    making it usable without providing own copy of the file in depending
    projects. The `WITH_FIND_MODULE` option is no longer needed. See [mosra/corrade#17](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/17).
-   Displaying all header files, plugin metadata files and resource files in
    project view to make use of some IDEs less painful (such as QtCreator)
-   Properly checking for C++ standard compiler flags to avoid adding
    conflicting ones (see [mosra/corrade#10](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/pull/10))
-   Gentoo ebuild (see [mosra/corrade#16](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/16))
-   Better handling of RPATH on macOS (see [mosra/corrade#18](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/pull/18))

@subsection corrade-changelog-2015-05-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Removed static initializers to avoid memory corruption in static builds
    (see [mosra/magnum#90](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/90)).
-   Plugin manager now correctly folows dependency order when unloading
    plugins.
-   Fixed issues with plugin manager having multiple global instances in static
    builds (see [mosra/corrade#15](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/15))
-   Fixed a crash in Clang caused by overly clever code (see
    [mosra/magnum#84](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/84))

@subsection corrade-changelog-2015-05-deprecated Deprecated APIs

No API was deprecated in this release.

@subsection corrade-changelog-2015-05-compatibility Potential compatibility breakages, removed APIs

-   Removed unused plugin replacement feature, as it had questionable benefits
    and no real use.
-   All functionality @ref corrade-changelog-2014-01-deprecated "deprecated in 2014.01"
    has been removed, namely:

    -   Removed deprecated ability to use relative includes (e.g.
        @cpp #include <Utility/Debug.h> @ce), use absolute paths
        (@cpp #include <Corrade/Utility/Debug.h> @ce) instead.
    -   Removed deprecated `Utility::String::split()` overload, use either
        @ref Utility::String::split() "split()" or
        @ref Utility::String::splitWithoutEmptyParts() "splitWithoutEmptyParts()"
        instead.

@section corrade-changelog-2014-06 2014.06

    different locations, making it possible to have debug and release libraries
    installed alongside each other

    the building easier
-   It's no longer needed to explicitly test validity of pointer returned from
    @cpp PluginManager::Manager::instance() @ce

@section corrade-changelog-2014-01 2014.01

Released 2014-01-21, tagged as
[v2014.01](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/releases/tag/v2014.01). See the
[release announcement](https://blog.magnum.graphics/announcements/january-2014-updates/)
for a high-level overview.

@subsection corrade-changelog-2014-01-dependencies Dependency changes

No dependency changes in this release.

@subsection corrade-changelog-2014-01-new New features

-   MSVC 2013 support in the `compatibility` branch
-   Ability to create @ref Containers::Array from initializer list
-   @ref Containers::Array::release() function to release ownership of the
    data, similar to @ref std::unique_ptr::release()
-   @ref Containers::Array::data() "Containers::Array[Reference]::data()"
    function for easier explicit data access and also disallowing pointer
    conversion of rvalue Array as it would result in access to deleted memory
    (GCC 4.8.1/Clang only).
-   Improved state change signals in @ref Interconnect::StateMachine
-   Support for multiple template arguments in @ref CORRADE_COMPARE_AS()
    macro in @ref TestSuite library.
-   @ref Utility::String::join() and @ref Utility::String::joinWithoutEmptyParts()
    functions.
-   @ref Utility::String::fromArray() convenience functions to create
    @ref std::string from either character array or @cpp nullptr @ce
-   Ability to retrieve list of all compiled-in resources in given group using
    @ref Utility::Resource::list()
-   Added @cpp read() @ce, @cpp readString() @ce, @cpp write() @ce and
    @cpp writeString() @ce functions to @ref Utility::Directory
-   New @ref CORRADE_HAS_TYPE() type traits macro, which now allows to use
    @ref Utility::Debug to print any container that is iterable with C++11
    range-based for.
-   New @ref CORRADE_TARGET_WINDOWS and @ref CORRADE_TARGET_UNIX
    preprocessor definitions and CMake variables.
-   All classes in documentation are now shown with corresponding @cpp #include @ce
    path

@subsection corrade-changelog-2014-01-changes Changes

-   @ref TestSuite tests now display @cb{.shell-session} ?: <unknown>() @ce in
    test output for test cases without any checks to make them more
    discoverable
-   Skipped test cases in @ref TestSuite tests are displayed without useless
    file/line information (unlike failed test cases, where the information is
    needed)
-   All deprecated functions and types are now emitting compiler warnings to
    encourage updating the code
-   Various documentation and example updates and improvements

@subsection corrade-changelog-2014-01-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   @ref TestSuite::Compare::File "TestSuite::Compare::*File*" is comparing
    the files in binary mode to avoid platform-dependent EOL issues.
-   @ref Utility::Resource now properly handles empty files when compiling
    resources.
-   @ref Utility::Directory is now working properly under Windows.
-   Fixed compilation issues with Clang and libc++
-   Fixed various compilation issues under MSVC (and worked around a much
    larger amount of compiler bugs)
-   Adapted @ref Utility::Configuration test to work under MinGW (see [mosra/corrade#7](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/pull/7))

@subsection corrade-changelog-2014-01-deprecated Deprecated APIs

-   @cpp Utility::String::split(..., bool) @ce is deprecated, use separate
    functions @ref Utility::String::split() "split()" and
    @ref Utility::String::splitWithoutEmptyParts() "splitWithoutEmptyParts()"
    instead.

@subsection corrade-changelog-2014-01-compatibility Potential compatibility breakages, removed APIs

-   Removed @cpp Utility::log2() @ce and @cpp Utility::pow2() @ce utility
    functions, as they weren't used anywhere anymore (and the latter one was a
    bad joke)
-   Removed useless metadata from @ref PluginManager::PluginMetadata class
    (author name, version, description), as they don't fit current use case
    anymore (they were used back in 2007 when Corrade was part of Kompas).
    These metadata can be easily added back as custom configuration values.
-   Removed now useless @cpp Utility::Translator @ce class, it was used only
    for plugin metadata and was prime example of bad design (exposing unguarded
    naked pointers)

@subsection corrade-changelog-2014-01-internal Internal changes

-   Using Jenkins Continuous Integration to maintain compilable and bug-free
    state of the project more easily. Currently GCC 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, 4.4,
    Clang 3.3, Clang 3.3 with libc++, Emscripten, x86-32/x86-64 Native Client
    and MinGW32 compilers are tested with both shared and static libraries.
    Separately testing builds with deprecated features enabled and disabled.
-   All files from `src/` directory were moved to `src/Corrade`, `examples/`
    directory was moved to `src/examples` (required to make inter-project
    includes absolute, as mentioned above)
