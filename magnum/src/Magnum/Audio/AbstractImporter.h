/**
@brief Base for audio importer plugins

Provides interface for importing various audio formats. See @ref plugins for
more information and `*Importer` classes in @ref Audio namespace for available
importer plugins.

@section Audio-AbstractImporter-data-dependency Data dependency

The data returned from various functions *by design* have no dependency on the
importer instance and neither on the dynamic plugin module. In other words, you don't need to keep the importer instance (or the plugin manager instance)
around in order to have the returned data valid. Moreover, all returned
@ref Corrade::Containers::Array instances are only allowed to have default
deleters --- this is to avoid potential dangling function pointer calls when
destructing such instances after the plugin module has been unloaded.

@section Audio-AbstractImporter-subclassing Subclassing

Plugin implements function @ref doFeatures(), @ref doIsOpened(), one of or both
@ref doOpenData() and @ref doOpenFile() functions, function @ref doClose() and
data access functions @ref doFormat(), @ref doFrequency() and @ref doData().

You don't need to do most of the redundant sanity checks, these things are
checked by the implementation:

-   Functions @ref doOpenData() and @ref doOpenFile() are called after the
    previous file was closed, function @ref doClose() is called only if there
    is any file opened.
-   Function @ref doOpenData() is called only if @ref Feature::OpenData is
    supported.
-   All `do*()` implementations working on opened file are called only if
    there is any file opened.

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par Dangling function pointers on plugin unload
    As @ref Trade-AbstractImporter-data-dependency "mentioned above",
    @ref Corrade::Containers::Array instances returned from plugin
    implementations are not allowed to use anything else than the default
    deleter, otherwise this could cause dangling function pointer call on array
    destruction if the plugin gets unloaded before the array is destroyed. This
    is asserted by the base implementation on return.
