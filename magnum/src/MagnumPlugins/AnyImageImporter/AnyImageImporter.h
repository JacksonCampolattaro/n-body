/**
@brief Any image importer plugin

Detects file type based on file extension, loads corresponding plugin and then
tries to open the file with it.

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`WITH_ANYIMAGEIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum. To use as a dynamic
plugin, you need to load the @cpp "AnyImageImporter" @ce plugin from
`MAGNUM_PLUGINS_IMPORTER_DIR`. To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of
another plugin with CMake, you need to request the `AnyImageImporter` component
of the `Magnum` package and link to the `Magnum::AnyImageImporter` target. See
@ref building, @ref cmake and @ref plugins for more information.

Supported formats:

-   Basis Universal (`*.basis`), loaded @ref BasisImporter or any other plugin
    that provides it
-   Windows Bitmap (`*.bmp`), loaded with any plugin that provides `BmpImporter`
-   DirectDraw Surface (`*.dds` or data with corresponding signature), loaded
    with @ref DdsImporter or any other plugin that provides it
-   Graphics Interchange Format (`*.gif`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `GifImporter`
-   OpenEXR (`*.exr` or data with corresponding signature), loaded with any
    plugin that provides `OpenExrImporter`
-   Radiance HDR (`*.hdr` or data with corresponding signature), loaded with
    any plugin that provides `HdrImporter`
-   JPEG (`*.jpg`, `*.jpe`, `*.jpeg` or data with corresponding signature),
    loaded with @ref JpegImporter or any other plugin that provides it
-   JPEG 2000 (`*.jp2`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `Jpeg2000Importer`
-   Multiple-image Network Graphics (`*.mng`), loaded with any plugin that
    provides `MngImporter`
-   Portable Bitmap (`*.pbm`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PbmImporter`
-   ZSoft PCX (`*.pcx`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PcxImporter`
-   Portable Graymap (`*.pgm`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `PgmImporter`
-   Softimage PIC (`*.pic`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PicImporter`
-   Portable Anymap (`*.pnm`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `PnmImporter`
-   Portable Network Graphics (`*.png` or data with corresponding signature),
    loaded with @ref PngImporter or any other plugin that provides it
-   Portable Pixmap (`*.ppm`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PpmImporter`
-   Adobe Photoshop (`*.psd`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PsdImporter`
-   Silicon Graphics (`*.sgi`, `*.bw`, `*.rgb`, `*.rgba`), loaded with any
    plugin that provides `SgiImporter`
-   Tagged Image File Format (`*.tif`, `*.tiff`), loaded with any plugin that
    provides `TiffImporter`
-   Truevision TGA (`*.tga`, `*.vda`, `*.icb`, `*.vst` or data with
    corresponding signature), loaded with @ref TgaImporter or any other plugin
    that provides it

Detecting file type through @ref openData() is supported only for a subset of
formats that are marked as such in the list above.
