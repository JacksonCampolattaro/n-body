@brief Checklists for developing new things in Magnum itself

@tableofcontents

This guide is meant mainly for core Magnum developers to avoid forgetting about
things. If you are contributing a pull-request, you can use these checklists as
a guide and save the maintainers a bit of work --- but you are not strictly
required to follow them to the point.

@section developers-library Checklist for adding / removing a library

1.  Add a `WITH_LIBRARYNAME` CMake option to:
    -   root `CMakeLists.txt` (if it has some inter-library dependencies,
        update the others / convert them to @cmake cmake_dependent_option() @ce,
        adding `NOT WITH_LIBRARYNAME` to their condition --- note the
        conditions are ANDed so they need to be specified in reverse)
    -   the list in `doc/building.dox` (and similar files in other repos)
2.  Update `FindMagnum.cmake` (or similar in other repos):
    -   mention the new lib in the list of components in the docs
    -   if it has some inter-library dependencies, add a corresponding
        `_MAGNUM_Component_DEPENDENCIES` entry
    -   add its name to the  `_MAGNUM_LIBRARY_COMPONENT_LIST` list
    -   add a new @cmake elseif(_component STREQUAL LibraryName) @ce section
        with special setup of includes or dependencies or explicitly say
        @cmake # No special setup for LibraryName library @ce
3.  Add the library to the list in `doc/cmake.dox` (or similar files in other
    repos)
4.  Add a conditional @cmake add_subdirectory() @ce to `src/Magnum/CMakeLists.txt`
5.  Create a new `src/Magnum/LibraryName/CMakeLists.txt`, copy over up-to-date
    license header from other CMake files, add your name to it and populate it:
    -   add source files to `MagnumLibraryName_SRCS` variable
    -   add installable headers to `MagnumLibraryName_HEADERS` variable
    -   add private headers to `MagnumLibraryName_PRIVATE_HEADERS` variable (if
        any)
    -   if the test needs some extra setup (such as e.g. @cpp CORRADE_NO_ASSERT @ce
        enabled for particular files), create a new `MagnumLibraryNameObjects`
        `OBJECT` library with files that can be compiled the same way in both
        cases to speed up compilation
    -   verify that the @cmake add_library() @ce command references all input
        files (needed so QtCreator lists all project files properly)
    -   verify that debug postfix is set
        (@cmake set_target_properties(MagnumLibraryName PROPERTIES DEBUG_POSTFIX "-d") @ce)
    -   verify that folder is set for all libraries and `OBJECT` libraries to
        avoid cluttering project tree view in IDEs
        (@cmake set_target_properties(MagnumLibraryName PROPERTIES FOLDER "Magnum/LibraryName") @ce)
    -   verify that target installation is done in proper places (separate
        `RUNTIME` / `LIBRARY` / `ARCHIVE` destinations)
    -   verify that @cmake set_target_properties(MagnumLibraryName PROPERTIES VERSION ${MAGNUM_LIBRARY_VERSION} SOVERSION ${MAGNUM_LIBRARY_SOVERSION}) @ce
        is done in case `BUILD_STATIC` is *not* set
    -   verify that @cmake set_target_properties(MagnumLibraryName PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) @ce
        is done in case `BUILD_STATIC_PIC` is set
    -   verify that @cmake add_library(Magnum::LibraryName ALIAS MagnumLibraryName) @ce
        (or equivalent) is added to make the library visible for CMake
        subprojects
6.  Create a new `src/Magnum/LibraryName/Test/` directory:
    -   add a `CMakeLists.txt` with pre-populated license header, add your name
        to it
    -   conditionally @cmake add_subdirectory() @ce it if `BUILD_TESTS` is
        enabled
7.  Create a new `src/Magnum/LibraryName/LibraryName.h` header for forward
    declarations (if needed), add a file-level doc block with
    <tt>Forward declarations for the \@ref Magnum::LibraryName namespace</tt>
    as brief docs
8.  Create a new `src/Magnum/LibraryName/visibility.h` header with
    `MAGNUM_LIBRARYNAME_EXPORT` and `MAGNUM_LIBRARYNAME_LOCAL` macros by
    copypasting it from another library:
    -   adapt @cpp #ifdef MagnumLibraryName_EXPORTS @ce so it matches CMake
        target name
    -   if the library is combined from an `OBJECT` library, add its name to
        the above @cpp #ifdef @ce as well (and then explicitly add
        @cmake target_compile_definitions(MagnumLibraryNameObjects PRIVATE "MagnumLibraryNameObjects_EXPORTS") @ce to `CMakeLists.txt` in case `BUILD_STATIC` is not set)
    -   the macro *does not* contain the full namespace path but rather mirrors
        the library *file* name
9.  Mention the directory and namespace in `doc/namespaces.dox`, basically
    copy-pasting the following from existing documentation:
    -   directory-level doc block referencing the namespace
    -   namespace-level doc block mentioning the `WITH_LIBRARYNAME` option,
        dependencies (if any) and a code snippet showing how to use it with
        CMake
10. Code and test the rest of the library, see @ref developers-file and
    @ref developers-symbol for more information
11. Add the `WITH_LIBRARYNAME` option to all files in `package/` directory,
    explicitly saying either `ON` or `OFF` based on platform support:
    -   all `package/archlinux/PKGBUILD*` files (and the AUR package(s))
    -   the `package/debian/rules` file (watch out, tabs!)
    -   the `package/gentoo/` `*.ebuild` file
    -   the `package/homebrew/` `*.rb` file (watch out, Ruby!)
    -   all `package/ci/appveyor-*.bat` files (`^` is a line continuation)
    -   all `package/ci/travis-*.sh` files (@c \\ is a line continuation)
12. If the library has dependencies:
    -   make sure they are mentioned in the library documentation
    -   make sure they are mentioned in building and CMake docs
    -   make sure they are mentioned in `CREDITS.md`
    -   make sure AppVeyor and Travis downloads them (based on platform
        support)
13. Mention the library in `doc/changelog.dox` (or similar files in other
    repos)
14. @ref building-doc "Build documentation":
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings
    -   eyeball the namespace and directory docs, fix suspicious things, look
        also in the building and cmake docs
15. Build a coverage build (`package/archlinux/PKGBUILD-coverage`), or abuse
    the CI for that later
16. Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
17. Iterate until the CIs are green and the code coverage is good enough
18. Merge to `master`

In order to remove a library, be sure to touch all places mentioned above, only
in inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first".

@section developers-application Checklist for adding / removing an application library

Similarly to @ref developers-library except points 2 and 5, with:

1.  Update `FindMagnum.cmake` (replaces point 2 in @ref developers-library):
    -   mention the new lib in the list of components in the docs
    -   add its name to the  `_MAGNUM_LIBRARY_COMPONENTS` regex
    -   add a new @cmake elseif(_component STREQUAL ApplicationName) @ce section
        with special setup of includes or dependencies or explicitly say
        @cmake # Name application has no additional dependencies @ce
2.  Add a condition to `src/Magnum/Platform/CMakeLists.txt`:
    -   add the source file to `MagnumApplicationName_SRCS` variable
    -   add the installable header to `MagnumApplicationName_HEADERS` variable
    -   add a `STATIC` `MagnumApplicationName` library, verify that the
        @cmake add_library() @ce command references all input files (needed so
        QtCreator lists all project files properly)
    -   verify that debug postfix is set
        (@cmake set_target_properties(MagnumApplicationName PROPERTIES DEBUG_POSTFIX "-d") @ce)
    -   verify that folder is set to avoid cluttering project tree view in IDEs
        (@cmake set_target_properties(MagnumApplicationName PROPERTIES FOLDER "Magnum/Platform") @ce)
    -   verify that target installation is done in proper places (separate
        `RUNTIME` / `LIBRARY` / `ARCHIVE` destinations)
    -   verify that @cmake add_library(Magnum::ApplicationName ALIAS MagnumApplicationName) @ce
        is added to make the application visible for CMake subprojects
3.  If desired, provide a new bootstrap project:
    -   new `base-applicationname` branch, forked from some `_modules_*`
        branch, with the rest copied from a subset of e.g. the `base` branch
    -   update `README.md` in master, mentioning this
    -   update `package/ci` files to build this project (probably a new matrix
        entry)
4.  Mention the bootstrap project in the class documentation
5.  Mention all extra files and setup in the class documentation

In order to remove an application library, be sure to touch all places
mentioned above, only in inverse --- but usually
@ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first".

@section developers-plugin Checklist for adding / removing a plugin

Similarly to @ref developers-library except points 2 and 5, with:

1.  Update `FindMagnumPlugins.cmake` (or `FindMagnum.cmake` in the core repo)
    (replaces point 2 in @ref developers-library):
    -   mention the new plugin in the list of components in the docs
    -   add its name to the  `_MAGNUMPLUGINS_PLUGIN_COMPONENT_LIST` list
    -   add a new @cmake elseif(_component STREQUAL PluginName) @ce section
        with special setup of includes or dependencies or explicitly say
        @cmake # PluginName has no dependencies @ce
2.  Create `PluginName.conf` and list all plugin dependencies (if any). The
    file has to be present even if empty.
4.  Create `importStaticPlugin.cpp` by copypasting it from another plugin and
    adapting plugin name. This will get installed along with plugin headers to
    aid with automatic import.
5.  Create `configure.h.cmake` for plugin-specific information about whether
    the library was built as static or not
6.  Create a new `src/MagnumPlugins/PluginName/CMakeLists.txt`, copy over
    up-to-date license header from other CMake files and populate it (replaces
    point 5 in @ref developers-library):
    -   add source files to `PluginName_SRCS` variable
    -   add installable headers to `PluginName_HEADERS` variable
    -   add private headers to `PluginName_PRIVATE_HEADERS` variable (if any)
    -   use @cmake add_plugin() @ce command (which is aliased to either
        @ref corrade-cmake-add-plugin "corrade_add_plugin()" or
        @ref corrade-cmake-add-static-plugin "corrade_add_static_plugin()") to
        create the `PluginName` library, use `${MAGNUM_PLUGINS_*_DEBUG_BINARY_INSTALL_DIR}`
        / `${MAGNUM_PLUGINS_*_RELEASE_BINARY_INSTALL_DIR}` and
        `${MAGNUM_PLUGINS_*_DEBUG_LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR}` /
        `${MAGNUM_PLUGINS_*_RELEASE_LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR}` variables that
        correspond to given plugin interface
    -   verify that both @cmake add_library() @ce and @cmake add_plugin() @ce
        commands reference all input files (needed so QtCreator lists all
        project files properly)
    -   verify that folder is set for all other targets to avoid cluttering
        project tree view in IDEs
        (@cmake set_target_properties(PluginExtraTarget PROPERTIES FOLDER "MagnumPlugins/PluginName") @ce)
        --- for the plugin library it's done automatically inside
        @cmake add_plugin() @ce
    -   verify that @cmake set_target_properties(PluginName PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) @ce
        is done in case `BUILD_STATIC_PIC` is set
    -   verify that in case of `BUILD_PLUGINS_STATIC` the
        `importStaticPlugin.cpp` file is installed  is set and that an
        *absolute* path to it is added to @cmake target_sources() @ce
    -   verify that @cmake add_library(MagnumPlugins::PluginName ALIAS PluginName) @ce
        (or equivalent) is added to make the library visible for CMake
        subprojects
7.  If there is more than one interface header (other than just `PluginName.h`
    being installed), add a new `visibility.h` header. Otherwise put the
    visibility macros directly in `PluginName.h`.
8.  If the plugin handles a new format:
    -   if the plugin is not named directly after the format, add an alias to
        it (for example the @ref Trade::MiniExrImageConverter "MiniExrImageConverter"
        plugin is aliased to `OpenExrImageConverter`)
    -   update the @ref Trade::AnyImageImporter "AnyImageImporter",
        @ref Trade::AnySceneImporter "AnySceneImporter",
        @ref Trade::AnyImageConverter "AnyImageConverter" or
        @ref Audio::AnyImporter "AnyAudioImporter" plugins to delegate to this
        plugin (or its alias) upon encountering corresponding file extension

In order to remove a plugin, be sure to touch all places mentioned above, only
in inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first".

@section developers-plugin-interface Checklist for adding / removing a plugin interface

@todoc write

In order to remove a plugin interface, be sure to touch all places mentioned
above, only in inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first".

@section developers-tool Checklist for adding / removing a tool

@todoc write

In order to remove a tool, be sure to touch all places mentioned above, only in
inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first".

@section developers-example Checklist for adding / removing an example

1.  Add a `WITH_EXAMPLENAME_EXAMPLE` CMake option to:
    -   root `CMakeLists.txt`
    -   the list in `doc/building-examples.dox`
2.  Add a new `src/example-name` directory, copy up-to-date UNLICENSE headers
    from other files in the repo
3.  Verify that `src/example-name/CMakeLists.txt` contains @cmake cmake_minimum_required() @ce,
    @cmake project() @ce and all @cmake cmake_policy() @ce commands so it can
    be used as a top-level project level
4.  If the example needs extra code to run on non-desktop platforms (and
    running on non-desktop platforms is not the primary goal), consider moving
    them to the `ports` branch to keep code in `master` as simple as possible
5.  Add a new `doc/example-name.dox` page with @c \@brief, @c \@m_footernavigation
    and @c \@page name equivalent to filename
6.  Add a new `doc/example-name.png` image, scaled down to 400x300 from
    800x600, reference it as `@image html example-name.png` from the `*.dox`
    file
7.  In case there's a web demo, add a button link to it (copy over other
    example pages and adapt)
8.  Add a new `examples-examplename-source` section with:
    -   link to GitHub
    -   referencing all textual example sources as
        <tt>-   \@ref example-name/file.ext "file.ext"</tt>
    -   breadcrumb and navigation setup for all example sources as
        <tt>\@example example-name/file.ext \@m_examplenavigation{examples-example-name,example-name/} \@m_footernavigation</tt>
9.  Update `doc/example-index.dox` and list the example there, optionally
    adding a badge to advertise the web demo
10. Mention the example in `doc/changelog-examples.dox`
11. Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next` or `ports-next`)
12. Iterate until the CIs are green
13. Merge to `master` / `ports`

In order to remove an example, be sure to touch all places mentioned above, but
in inverse.

@section developers-file Checklist for adding / removing a new source / header file

1.  Copy over a up-to-date license header (note that example code uses
    UNLICENSE instead of MIT) and add your name + year to it, if not already
    there
2.  Add a <tt>\@file</tt>-level documentation block, with @c \@brief listing
    all classes, functions, typedefs, enums, macros etc. that are in the file
3.  Add the file to corresponding `*_SRCS`, `*_HEADERS`, `*_PRIVATE_HEADERS`
    list in `CMakeLists.txt`
4.  If applicable, add a new test class file in the `Test/` directory
    -   name it `FileNameTest.cpp`, put a class named `FileNameTest` inside,
        wrapped in a `Test` subnamespace of the original file namespace
    -   use @cmake corrade_add_test() @ce to add it to tests
    -   if some tests need GL context, add a separate test with `GLTest`
        suffix, wrapping the corresponding @cmake corrade_add_test() @ce in
        @cmake if(BUILD_GL_TESTS) @ce
5.  Populate the file, see @ref developers-symbol and @ref coding-style for
    more information.
6.  Mention the new functionality in `doc/changelog.dox` (and similar files in
    other repos)
7.  @ref building-doc "Build documentation":
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings
    -   eyeball the relevant docs and fix suspicious things
8.  Build a coverage build (`package/archlinux/PKGBUILD-coverage`), or abuse
    the CI for that later
9.  Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
10. Iterate until the CIs are green and the code coverage is good enough
11. Merge to `master`

In order to remove a file, be sure to touch all places mentioned above, only
in inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first".

@section developers-symbol Checklist for adding / removing a symbol

1.  If the symbol is standalone (i.e., not member of a class), list it in the
    <tt>\@file</tt>-level @c \@brief docs
2.  Document it
3.  Add a test for it to corresponding file, verify the test gets actually run
4.  Mention the new functionality in `doc/changelog.dox` (and similar files in
    other repos)
5.  @ref building-doc "Build documentation":
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings
    -   eyeball the relevant docs and fix suspicious things
6.  Build a coverage build (`package/archlinux/PKGBUILD-coverage`), or abuse
    the CI for that later
7.  Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
8.  Iterate until the CIs are green and the code coverage is good enough
9.  Merge to `master`

In order to remove a symbol, be sure to touch all places mentioned above, only
in inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first".

@section developers-page Checklist for adding a new CMake documentation page

1.  Add a `doc/pagename.dox` file, copy up-to-date license header and add your
    name + year to it, if not already there
2.  If the page is top-level, list it in `doc/00-page-order.dox` to ensure it
    gets listed at a proper place
3.  If the page is not top-level, list it using @c \@subpage in its parent page
    and add @c \@m_footernavigation for automatic linking to parent and
    prev/next pages
4.  Add a @c \@brief documentation, if applicable
5.  Populate it, see @ref coding-style for more information
6.  Mention the new page in `doc/changelog.dox` (and similar files in other
    repos)
7.  @ref building-doc "Build documentation":
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings
    -   eyeball the relevant docs and fix suspicious things
8.  Push to `master`

@section developers-deprecation Checklist for deprecating a feature

1.  If the feature is publicly exposed, think about the best way of deprecation
    that preserves source compatibility:
    -   Add a compatibility @cpp typedef @ce / @cpp using @ce for a renamed
        symbol, marking it with @ref CORRADE_DEPRECATED() / @ref CORRADE_DEPRECATED_ALIAS()
    -   Add a compatibility header for a renamed include, including the
        original file from it and marking it with @ref CORRADE_DEPRECATED_FILE().
        Ensure the file is not included from anywhere else anymore, since that
        would mean the user then gets spammed with more than just one warning
        per included file. This macro also can't easily be disabled on most
        platforms.
    -   Add a compatibility inline function for a function that got renamed or
        its arguments changed, mark it with @ref CORRADE_DEPRECATED()
    -   Add a compatibility enum value for a value that got renamed or deleted,
        mark it with @ref CORRADE_DEPRECATED_ENUM()
    -   Don't *ever* change semantics of function arguments without changing
        the function signature. That would silently break with no possibility
        to let the user know.
    -   Function return type changes are hard. One possibility is working
        around that by returning a wrapper type that's implicitly convertible
        to both the old and new type, another is introducing a differently
        named function instead. The last resort is breaking the API without
        preserving backwards compatibility --- but that makes people angry, so
        avoid that if possible.
2.  Add just a <tt>\@brief \@copybrief</tt> from the replacement functionality
    together with a @c \@deprecated  line to the deprecated feature
3.  Reference the replacement functionality in both the deprecation macro and
    in the @c \@deprecated line to make porting easier
4.  Ensure the deprecated symbol is wrapped in @cpp #ifndef MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED @ce,
5.  Ensure deprecated files @cpp #error @ce in case they get used in
    non-deprecated build, ensure they are not installed in non-deprecated
    builds
6.  Build all tests and dependent projects and verify that:
    -   using the old functionality still compiles and works as intended
    -   deprecation warnings are emitted in proper places
7.  Upon verifying the above, start updating dependent code
8.  Mention the deprecated API in the deprecation section of `doc/changelog.dox`
    (and similar files in other repos)
9.  @ref building-doc "Build documentation":
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings
    -   eyeball the relevant docs and fix suspicious things
10.  Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
11. Iterate until the CIs are green
12. Merge to `master`
13. If possible, trigger builds of dependent projects (where they are still
    using the old API) and verify they are still green (and red in
    non-deprecated build)
14. Update dependent projects

@section developers-deprecation-library Checklist for deprecating a whole library

1.  If there's no compatible replacement (for example when removing support for
    an outdated toolkit), think about possible alternatives, external libraries
    or other ways to reach the same goal.
2.  Add deprecation notes, listing alternatives
    -   to docs of the whole namespace and all its members
    -   to docs of the directory and all files inside
    -   to all feature overview pages
    -   to each symbol using one of the @ref CORRADE_DEPRECATED() macros, with
        a shorter note mentioning alternatives
    -   ensure each public headers (transitively) contains exactly one
        @ref CORRADE_DEPRECATED_FILE() macro to warn the user *exactly once*
        about including a deprecated header --- in particular, putting it in
        every file would spam the user way too much
    -   since the files are still compiled and included by the library, wrap it
        in @cpp #ifndef _MAGNUM_DO_NOT_WARN_DEPRECATED_LIBRARYNAME @ce and
        @cpp #define @ce this macro in all `*.cpp` files and tests to avoid
        spamming the compiler log
    -   an @cpp #error @ce to each header file in case @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED
        is not enabled
    -   wrap contents of every header, source and test file in
        @ref CORRADE_IGNORE_DEPRECATED_PUSH and @ref CORRADE_IGNORE_DEPRECATED_POP
        to avoid warnings when compiling the library itself (no, this doesn't
        disable warnings for library *users*)
    -   a @cmake message(FATAL_ERROR) @ce to corresponding `CMakeLists.txt` in
        case @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED is not enabled
    -   a @m_class{m-label m-danger} **deprecated** label next to the `WITH_*`
        CMake option in the corresponding `doc/building.dox` page and next to
        the CMake component name in the corresponding `doc/cmake.dox` page
        (and similar files in other repos), possibly also to all pages that
        list it (if any)
3.  If the library was enabled by default, make it disabled by default. Update
    relevant sections in `doc/building.dox` and `doc/cmake.dox`.
4.  Include the library component in the corresponding `Find` module component
    list only if @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED is enabled.
5.  Remove the deprecated library from all packages except developer `PKGBUILD`s
    and CIs, remove also its no-longer-needed dependencies from these packages
6.  Verify no other libraries, projects or examples depend on given library
    anymore. If they do:
    -   rework examples to not use the deprecated functionality anymore
    -   if there are dependencies in other libraries or projects, make the
        related features deprecated in the same manner, building them only
        if @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED is enabled
    -   update corresponding `Find` modules to require dependency on this
        library only if @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED is enabled
7.  Verify no CIs in dependent projects have this library enabled. If they do,
    it should be only if @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED is enabled and only if
    there is a (deprecated) feature depending on this library.
8.  Mention the deprecated library in the deprecation section of `doc/changelog.dox`
    (and similar files in other repos), note the alternatives and note that
    it's no longer built by default or included in any packages (in case it was
    before)

@section developers-removing Checklist for removing a feature

1.  Check that it was in deprecated state for more than a year with at least
    one release in between. Check that no important clients depend on it
    anymore. If not, wait a bit more.
2.  Remove relevant blocks wrapped in @cpp #ifndef MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED @ce,
    remove relevant deprecated files and update `CMakeLists.txt`
3.  Mention the removed API in the compatibility section of `doc/changelog.dox`
    (or similar files in other repos)
4.  @ref building-doc "Build documentation":
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings --- sometimes it happens that a
        deprecated API is still being referenced
5.  Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
6.  Iterate until the CIs are green
7.  Merge to `master`
8.  If possible, trigger builds of dependent projects and verify they are still
    green (or wait for the scheduled builds)

@section developers-gl-extensions Checklist for adding / removing GL versions and extensions

1.  Install [flextGL](https://github.com/mosra/flextgl)
2.  Go to `src/MagnumExternal/OpenGL/GL/`:
    -   Update `extensions.txt` (bump a version or add/remove extensions)
    -   Run @cb{.sh} .../flextGLgen.py -D . -t . extensions.txt @ce to generate
        `flextGL.h`, `flextGL.cpp` and `flextGLPlatform.cpp` files
3.  Go to `src/MagnumExternal/OpenGL/GLES2/`:
    -   Update `extensions.txt` and `Emscripten/extensions.txt` (add/remove
        extensions)
    -   Run @cb{.sh} .../flextGLgen.py -D . -t . extensions.txt @ce to generate
        `flextGL.h`, `flextGL.cpp`, `flextGLPlatform.cpp`,
        `flextGLWindowsDesktop.h`, `flextGLWindowsDesktop.cpp`,
        `flextGLPlatformWindowsDesktop.cpp` and `flextGLPlatformIOS.cpp` files.
        Desktop GLES on Windows still links to the ancient `opengl32.dll`
        which exports only OpenGL 1.1 symbols, so we have a special set of
        headers that queries pointers for everything above OpenGL 1.1 (instead
        of everything above OpenGL ES 2.0). iOS, on the other hand, doesn't
        have any extension loader mechanism and all supported entrypoints are
        exported from the library, so we set the function pointers to those
        exported symbols in case the system GL header defines them.
    -   Run @cb{.sh} .../flextGLgen.py -D . -t Emscripten/ Emscripten/extensions.txt @ce
        to generate a stripped-down `flextGLEmscripten.h` file. Emscripten
        doesn't have the ability to manually load extension pointers, thus it
        has only header files.
4.  Go to `src/MagnumExternal/OpenGL/GLES3/`:
    -   Update `extensions.txt` and `Emscripten/extensions.txt` (bump a version
        or add/remove extensions)
    -   Run @cb{.sh} .../flextGLgen.py -D . -t . extensions.txt @ce to generate
        `flextGL.h`, `flextGL.cpp`, `flextGLPlatform.cpp`,
        `flextGLWindowsDesktop.h`, `flextGLWindowsDesktop.cpp`,
        `flextGLPlatformWindowsDesktop.cpp` and `flextGLPlatformIOS.cpp` files.
        See above why there are so many.
    -   Run @cb{.sh} .../flextGLgen.py -D . -t Emscripten/ Emscripten/extensions.txt @ce
        to generate a stripped-down `flextGLEmscripten.h` file. See above for
        details.
5.  Check @cb{.sh} git diff @ce for suspicious changes and whitespace-at-EOL
6.  For every new added function, add an entry to `doc/opengl-mapping.dox`
7.  For every new added limit query (various `GL_MIN_*` and `GL_MAX_*` macros
    etc.), add an entry to the bottom of `doc/opengl-mapping.dox`
8.  Add a table listing the new version and all new extensions in it to
    `doc/opengl-support.dox` (take a list of them from the changelog in the
    official spec PDF). Some extensions might be already present in the general
    extension list, move them out of there.
9.  Add a new `requires-glXY`, `requires-glesXY` or `requires-webglXY` page
    with @c \@m_footernavigation to `doc/opengl-support.dox`, mention it as a
    @c \@subpage at a correct position in the list
10. Add a new `requires-glXY`, `requires-glesXY` or `requires-webglXY` alias
    to `Doxyfile`, `Doxyfile-mcss` and `Doxyfile-public`, copypaste it from
    existing and change the numbers
11. Add new version enum value:
    -   to `src/Magnum/GL/Version.h`
    -   to debug output in `src/Magnum/GL/Version.cpp`
    -   to @ref GL::Extension::extensions() in `src/Magnum/GL/Context.cpp`
    -   to @cpp GL::Context::tryCreate() @ce in `src/Magnum/GL/Context.cpp`
    -   to specify GLSL version in `src/Magnum/GL/Shader.cpp`
    -   to the list in `src/Magnum/Platform/gl-info.cpp`
    -   to the test in `src/Magnum/GL/Test/ContextTest.cpp`
12. Add new extensions to `src/Magnum/GL/Extensions.h`
    -   order them by extension ID that is mentioned in every extension spec
        file
    -   update the numbering to stay monotonic and unique, round up start index
        of next section to nearest ten to make the updates bearable
    -   in case there's a lot of new extensions, @cpp Implementation::ExtensionCount @ce
        might needed to be increased
    -   run `ContextTest` to verify everything is still okay
13. Update existing extensions with version in which they become core (last
    parameter of the `_extension()` macro)
14. Update extension list in `src/magnum/GL/Context.cpp` according to changes
    in `src/Magnum/GL/Extensions.h`

In order to remove GL functionality, be sure to touch all places mentioned
above, only in inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first",
unless it doesn't affect public API at all.

@section developers-gl-functionality Checklist for adding / removing GL functionality

1.  Check if given desktop functionality has equivalent in ES or WebGL, add
    missing extensions if needed (see @ref developers-gl-extensions)
2.  Check if there's a DSA / non-DSA way to do the thing. Omit the non-DSA way
    if all drivers that support given functionality support DSA as well and
    there's no corresponding non-DSA functionality in ES or WebGL.
3.  If the functionality uses different entry points / defines on desktop and
    ES / WebGL platforms, use @cpp #ifdef MAGNUM_TARGET_GLES @ce,
    @cpp #ifdef MAGNUM_TARGET_GLES2 @ce and @cpp #ifdef MAGNUM_TARGET_WEBGL @ce
    to cover the differences
4.  If the functionality can use different entry points based on driver
    capabilities on the same platform (DSA / non-DSA is one of them), add
    separate code paths:
    -   new private and `MAGNUM_LOCAL` `thingImplementation*()` functions, each
        implementing one code path, preferrably @cpp static @ce
    -   a `thingImplementation` (member) function pointer in `src/Magnum/Implementation/SomeState.h`
        that gets populated in `src/Magnum/GL/Implementation/SomeState.cpp`
        based on extension / version availability
    -   a public function, dispatching to
        @cpp Context::current().state().some->thingImplementation @ce in the
        implementation
5.  If the functionality is a limit query, add a cache for it:
    -   a member variable that's either set to @cpp 0 @ce or
        @ref Corrade::Containers::NullOpt in `src/Magnum/Implementation/SomeState.cpp`
    -   the query first checks for presence of cached value and queries it only
        if not cached yet
    -   in case the limit query depends on some extension which might not be
        available, return some reasonable value (@cpp 0 @ce) in that case
6.  Implement the functionality (see @ref developers-file, @ref developers-symbol)
7.  Document the functionality
    -   if important, describe the different code paths (DSA / non-DSA) or
        functionality fallbacks
    -   list the DSA / non-DSA distinction among function list in the
        class-level docs
    -   a @c \@see block listing GL APIs used with @c \@fn_gl{}, @c \@def_gl{}
        etc., use @c \@fn_gl_keyword{}  etc. to expose them in search if
        desired (see @ref coding-style-documentation-commands-ref)
    -   list version / extension requirements using @c \@requires_glXY etc.
        (see @ref coding-style-documentation-commands-requires)
8.  Add the function or limit query to the mapping table in `doc/opengl-mapping.dox`,
    possibly to multiple places
9.  Update relevant extension support in tables in `doc/opengl-support.dox`
10. Mention the new stuff in `doc/changelog.dox`
11. @ref building-doc "Build documentation":
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings
    -   eyeball the relevant docs and fix suspicious things
12. Build and test for relevant platforms locally (as the public CI can't test
    GL things yet)
13. Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
14. Iterate until the CIs are green
15. Merge to `master`

In order to remove GL functionality, be sure to touch all places mentioned
above, only in inverse --- but usually @ref developers-deprecation "deprecate first",
unless it doesn't affect public API at all.

@section developers-driver-workaround Checklist for adding / removing a driver workaround

1.  Put a descriptive string with even more descriptive comment into the
    `KnownWorkarounds` array in `src/Magnum/GL/Implementation/driverSpecific.cpp`,
    ideally reuse some of the already existing vendor prefixes
2.  If the workaround can be tied down to a particular platform / target, add
    apropriate @cpp #ifdef @ce around it
3.  Create (or extend) a pair of (member) @cpp private @ce `MAGNUM_LOCAL`
    `*Implementation*()` functions in the affected class, `*ImplementationDefault()`
    having the optimistic default behavior, the other having the workaround.
    Add the appropriate @cpp #ifdef @ce around, if any.
4.  Add a new (member) function pointer in `src/GL/Implementation/SomeState.h`
    and call it from the affected class instead of executing the implementation
    directly. Add the appropriate @cpp #ifdef @ce around, if any.
5.  Add a branch into `src/GL/Implementation/SomeState.cpp` (with appropriate
    @cpp #ifdef @ce around, if any). First check for driver and other
    circumstances and call the @cpp !context.isDriverWorkaroundDisabled("the-workaround-string") @ce
    <em>last</em> after you are really sure you need to use it --- calling this
    function will append the workaround string to the engine startup log and
    it's not desirable to list workarounds that weren't used.
6.  Test the affected functionality with the workaround enabled and verify it
    works
7.  Disable the workaround using `--magnum-disable-workarounds` on command-line
    and verify it's still broken --- if not, there's something off!
8.  Add a changelog entry.
9.  Verify the driver workaround is listed in the snippet in
    @ref opengl-workarounds

Removeing a workaround is simply a matter of searching for its string, removing
all occurences of that string and removing all `*Implementation*()` functions
that were used only if the workaround was in place. No need to deprecate
anything, users explicitly disabling given workaround will only be informed
that such workaround does not exist anymore.

@section developers-al-extensions Checklist for adding / removing OpenAL versions and extensions

@section developers-dependency Checklist for adding, removing or updating a dependency

1.  Verify that there are no important clients stuck on the old version with no
    easy way to upgrade
    -   Corrade's root `CMakeLists.txt` (and `UseCorrade.cmake`) contains
        checks for minimal CMake and compiler version, together with a comment
        explaining which distribution / system has the minimal version.
2.  In case of CMake:
    -   it's usually possible to jump more than one version, check what's the
        version on the oldest supported system
    -   bump all @cmake cmake_minimum_required() @ce in all repos
    -   remove @cmake cmake_policy() @ce calls that are not needed anymore
    -   remove old workarounds, check changelogs for functionality that can be
        used now
    -   update building docs to say what version is required now
    -   add an entry to the dependencies section in `doc/changelog.dox`
    -   update `package/ci/travis.yml` to download a newer version, possibly
        removing 32-bit compat libraries
3.  In case of a compiler:
    -   remove everything related to `CORRADE_GCCXY_COMPATIBILITY` of the old
        version, if applicable
    -   update building docs to say what version is required now
    -   add an entry to the dependencies section in `doc/changelog.dox`
    -   update files in `package/ci/` to use a newer version
4.  In case given dependency is external:
    -   Create a dedicated `Find*.cmake` module and does not have a builtin one
        in CMake
    -   update packages in `package/` to depend on the new library
    -   update files in `package/ci/` to install it
5.  In case given dependency is single-file:
    -   verify it's reasonably small (&lt;50kB is okay, `nlohmann/json` is a
        prime example of *not okay*)
    -   add it to `src/external/` without any modifications except for trailing
        whitespace cleanup
    -   add it in a separate Git commit, mentioning its version (or Git hash)
        for easier upgrades later
6.  Update `CREDITS.md` of affected repo to mention the added/removed
    dependency, its homepage and its license

In order to remove a dependency, be sure to touch all places mentioned above,
only in inverse.

@section developers-port Checklist for adding or removing a port

1.  Add a new `TARGET_*` variable:
    -   to root `CMakeLists.txt`, which either gets enabled automatically based
        on system introspection or is exposed through an @cmake option() @ce
        command
    -   to the list of variables extracted out of `configure.h` in
        `modules/FindMagnum.cmake`
2.  Add a `MAGNUM_TARGET_*` variable:
    -   set it in root `CMakeLists.txt` in case `TARGET_*` is enabled
    -   add it as a @cpp #cmakedefine @ce macro to `src/Magnum/configure.h.cmake`
    -   add documentation for it to `src/Magnum/Magnum.h`
    -   mention it in `modules/FindMagnum.cmake` docs
    -   mention it in `doc/cmake.dox` and `doc/building.dox`
3.  Add a new Travis / AppVeyor matrix build for this port (or update existing)
4.  Add a new `PKGBUILD-*` file in `package/archlinux` for testing (or update
    existing)
5.  Enable or disable functionality using @cmake if(MAGNUM_TARGET_*) @ce in
    CMake and @cpp #ifdef MAGNUM_TARGET_* @ce in C++
6.  Mention the new stuff in `doc/changelog.dox`
7.  Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
8.  Iterate until the CIs are green
9.  Merge to `master`

In order to remove a port, be sure to touch all places mentioned above, only in
inverse.

@section developers-bootstrap Checklist for updating the bootstrap repo

1.  Check out the `_modules_` branch and update files in `modules/`
2.  Check out the `_modules_sdl2_` branch, merge `_modules_` to it, update
    remaining files in `modules/`
3.  Check out the `_modules_es_` branch, merge `_modules_sdl2_` to it, update
    remaining files in `modules/`
4.  Check out all other (non-underscored) branches one by one
    -   use @cb{.sh} git branch --list -v @ce to keep track
    -   merge proper `_modules_*` branches to them, fix potential file deletion
        conflicts
    -   update `toolchain` submodule, if present
5.  Push all branches
6.  Trigger build on `master`, update the `README.md` or files in `package/ci`
    if necessary

@section developers-copyright-year Checklist for updating copyright year

1.  Verify there are no uncommitted changes in any repos, as that would
    significantly complicate reverting a potential fuck-up
2.  Use [msrp](https://github.com/malex984/msrp) to batch replace copyright
    info in all files, replacing existing `Copyright © ...` with
    `Copyright © ..., 20XZ` in the root directory of every project, so nothing
    gets left out
3.  Examples use partially MIT (mainly in docs) and partially UNLICENSE,
    replace `... —` with `..., 20XZ —` there as well
4.  Copy all `Find*.cmake` modules to dependent projects to update the
    copyright year in these as well
5.  Update `package/debian/copyright` to say the new year as well
6.  Use @cb{.sh} git diff @ce to verify the change went well and the new year
    is specified exactly once everywhere
7.  Do a local verification build, push to `master`

@section developers-documentation Checklist for uploading documentation

1.  (Optionally) remove `build/doc-public` to get rid of stale files
2.  Verify there are no untracked files, modifications or branches different
    than `master` checked out that could mess up the docs
3.  Run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-public`,
    look for suspicious warnings
4.  Upload contents of `build/doc-public/html/` to `doc/magnum-new/` and remove
    `doc/magnum-old/` if any
5.  Once the upload is finished, rename `doc/magnum/` to `doc/magnum-old/` and
    `doc/magnum-new/` to `doc/magnum/`
6.  Quickly check that the docs still look as they should, if not, revert the
    backup and try again

@section developers-pr Checklist for merging a PR

1.  After the public round of review, pull the changes locally to a temporary
    branch (i.e., `next`)
2.  Verify a coverage build, verify that there are no compiler warnings
3.  Go over and fix issues that slipped through cracks in the public review
4.  Verify the contributor is mentioned in all relevant license headers, add if
    necessary
5.  Add the contributor to `CREDITS.md`, if not already there
6.  Update `doc/changelog.dox` (and similar files in other repos), if not
    already done
7.  @ref building-doc "Build documentation:
    -   run [doxygen.py](http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/) on `Doxyfile-mcss`
        and verify there are no new warnings
    -   eyeball the relevant docs and fix suspicious things
8.  Push to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`)
9.  Iterate until the CIs are green
10. Merge to `master`, put a "thank you" comment to the PR, explaining
    additional changes if necessary

@section developers-release Checklist for making a release

1.  Open a new `20XY.ac` milestone
2.  Verify that there are no blocking issues in the current (`20XY.ab`)
    milestone, either fix them or move to the next milestone
3.  Verify that all CIs are green
4.  Go through `doc/changelog.dox` and update it, in case it doesn't contain
    all changes (use `gitk` to check when it was last updated)
5.  Go through fixed issues and merged PRs and add either a
    @m_span{m-label m-success m-flat} changelog mention added @m_endspan (and
    add a mention to the changelog), @m_span{m-label m-danger m-flat} scrapped @m_endspan
    or @m_span{m-label m-dim m-flat} no action needed @m_endspan label to wrap
    them up
    -   Don't forget about the bootstrap repository and toolchains as well
6.  Go through merged PRs (and the *most important* issues) and add new people
    to `dox/credits.md` (and similar files in other repositories) and
    https://magnum.graphics/about/, if they are not there yet
7.  Update changelog for the next release:
    -   change section names for the latest release from `latest` to `20XY-ab`
    -   change the title from `Changes since 20XY.aa` to `20XY.ab`
    -   add a paragraph stating date of release and referencing the to-be-added
        tag on GitHub
    -   add a temporary <tt>\@<b></b>anchor changelog-latest</tt> (and
        equivalent in other repos) on top so the links from main page work
        properly
8.  Bump `MAGNUM_LIBRARY_VERSION` and `MAGNUM_LIBRARY_SOVERSION` in all
    projects, if needed --- ensure all projects have the exact same version
9.  Rebuild all projects with the new shared library version numbers, verify
    all tools and examples still behave properly
10. Build and upload public docs (see @ref developers-documentation), verify
    that there are no new warnings and the changelog looks correct
11. Push all new changes to a temporary branch (e.g., `next`), don't forget the
    `ports` branch in examples
12. Wait for the CIs to get green
13. Update `conanfile.py` in all projects that have it with a new version ---
    this *has to be* done before the version is tagged.
14. Update Debian package changelog in `package/debian/changelog`, copypasting
    the last entry, updating it and using @cb{.sh} date -R @ce for a date ---
    again, this *should be* done before the version is tagged so stable
    releases in PPAs can be done directly from the tag with no extra patching
15. Tag a new version using @cb{.sh} git tag -a v20XY.ab @ce, say just
    `Version 20XY.ab` as a message
16. Push the tag, verify that the CIs are still green
    -   to GitLab as well
17. Update the Corrade and Magnum tagfiles on the website using the
    freshly-built *public* docs
18. Write a release announcement for the blog
    -   highlight the most prominent features, mention detailed blog posts
        about them, if any
    -   reference detailed changelogs for all projects at the end
    -   don't forget to say thanks to significant contributors
    -   create some fancy eye-catchy cover image featuring nice screenshots of
        new functionality
    -   add release annoucement link under the button on front page
19. Publish the release announcement, verify it looks correct
20. Advertise the release announcement, preferrably Monday 5 PM, never Friday
    or weekends
    -   come up with some 100-character-long extended title
    -   Twitter (extended title + url and some hashtags), first dry-run the
        link on https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator to ensure the cover
        image gets displayed
    -   GitHub Release Radar (releaseradar@github.com)
    -   Reddit `r/cpp`, `r/gamedev`, `r/webassembly`, `r/vulkan`, `r/webgl`,
        `r/gltf`; Hacker News (extended title + url)
    -   summarize the release to mailing list
    -   summarize the release highlighting GL- and Vulkan-related functionality
        and submit that to Khronos, with a 500x500 downsized cover image
    -   send an e-mail to companies and universities on the private list
    -   add a message to the Gitter chat (title as heading, cover image,
        summary in a blockquote and "read more" link, `@` contributors)
21. Reference Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and mailing list in a "Discussion"
    note at the end of the article, reupload that change
22. Update versions of ArchLinux AUR packages:
    -   run `makepkg` in `package/archlinux/magnum*-git`, verify it builds and
